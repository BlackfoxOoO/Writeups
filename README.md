# Welcome 📝🔒

Welcome to my public repository of penetration-testing writeups.
Here, you'll find my documentation for Hack The Box (HTB), TryHackMe (THM) machines, and other kinds of challenges.

## 🏆 My Goals

* Build a strong public record of my penetration-testing and documentation skills
* Help anyone who wants to learn from real-world scenarios
* Sharpen my workflow and documentation for professional use

## ⚠️ Legal

All content here is for **educational purposes only** and was performed on **legally authorized machines** (e.g., HTB, Proving Grounds, or private labs).
Never test these techniques on systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to attack!
