# OSCP & HTB Writeups 📝🔒

Welcome to my public repository of penetration testing writeups and notes.  
Here, you'll find detailed walkthroughs for Hack The Box (HTB) machines and OSCP-style challenges, complete with step-by-step commands, tool explanations, and practical exploitation techniques.

## 🏆 My Goals

- Build a strong public record of my OSCP and Active Directory hacking skills
- Help others learn from real-world scenarios
- Sharpen my workflow and documentation for professional use

All content here is for **educational purposes only** and was performed on **legally obtained machines (e.g., HTB, Proving Grounds, or labs)**.
